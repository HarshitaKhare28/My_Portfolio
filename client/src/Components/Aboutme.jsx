            I'm Harshita Khare, a passionate and driven Computer Science Engineering student at RCoEM. 
            My journey in tech began with curiosity and has since evolved into a deep commitment to learning and creating. 
            I specialize in full-stack web development, combining both front-end and back-end technologies to build seamless, responsive, and user-friendly applications. 
            In addition, I have a strong interest in data analysis, where I enjoy uncovering patterns and insights from complex datasets.
            </p>
            <p>
            I am well-versed in programming languages such as C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript, which allows me to tackle a wide range of technical challenges efficiently. 
            My hands-on experience spans across powerful frameworks and tools like React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. 
            I'm constantly exploring new domainsâ€”whether it's mastering cloud services like Microsoft Azure, understanding containerization with Docker, or diving into machine learning.
            </p>
            <p>
            Beyond the code, I take pride in solving real-world problems through technology. 
            I'm an avid participant in competitive programming and hackathons, which help sharpen my problem-solving abilities and push me to think outside the box. 
            With each project, I aim not just to build something functional, but also impactful and meaningful. 
            I believe in continuous learning, collaboration, and using technology to make a positive difference.
